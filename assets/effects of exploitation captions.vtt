00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.600
often we're asked why don't victims just&nbsp;
leave this is a really complex crime and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:18.000
perpetrators use a multitude of tactics to coerce&nbsp;
and manipulate their victims perpetrators exploit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.600
the victim's immigration status they may withhold&nbsp;
their documentation the victim might not even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:35.400
have any documentation they may use the victim's&nbsp;
dependency or emotional attachment to them they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:45.400
may use threats of physical violence against them&nbsp;
or towards their family members to gain complicity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:54.960
exploiters will use any vulnerability to gain&nbsp;
power and control over that individual sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.720
perpetrators make victims fearful of authorities&nbsp;
and unaware of anything support that is available&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:11.320
to them the victim may feel indebted to the&nbsp;
exploiter financially or in other ways the victim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.720
themselves may be complicit with what is going&nbsp;
on and could be receiving some money housing or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.320
security and even if this is the case it does not&nbsp;
mean they are not being exploited and controlled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.680
victims limited choices and circumstances&nbsp;
increase the exposure to manipulation by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:42.200
the perpetrators which can lead to a cycle of&nbsp;
exploitation that they cannot see a way out all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:52.240
of these factors and more leveraged upon a victim&nbsp;
just increases the exploiters control over them
