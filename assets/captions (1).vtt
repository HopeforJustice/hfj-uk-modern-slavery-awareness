00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.320
most people rarely hear stories about modern&nbsp;
slavery and human trafficking and even fewer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.000
people are aware that modern slavery and&nbsp;
human trafficking happens right here in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.800
the UK unfortunately the little that we do see in&nbsp;
the news or on social media can misrepresent the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.840
reality that victims of modern day slavery and&nbsp;
human trafficking experience modern day slavery&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.960
and human trafficking is based upon using men&nbsp;
women and children as commodities for financial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.280
gain victims of this crime are often sold for&nbsp;
forced labour sexual exploitation domestic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.920
servitude criminal exploitation and even organ&nbsp;
harvesting exploiting them through a means of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.600
force fraud deception and coercion we can easily&nbsp;
think that this only happens to people in far away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.200
countries but the reality is that there are more&nbsp;
people enslaved in the world today than at any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.040
point in human history and the international&nbsp;
labour organisation estimates that there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.600
nearly 50 million victims trapped in modern day&nbsp;
slavery somewhere in the world today to put that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.120
in context for you that's nearly five times more&nbsp;
than the population of London currently trapped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.160
and throughout the UK there have been increasing&nbsp;
numbers some look like a teenage boy who's been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.120
coerced into cross county lines to smuggle and&nbsp;
distribute cannabis or it could be a woman who's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.040
been trafficked into the country under false&nbsp;
pretences had her passport taken off her and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.720
forced into online sex work or it might be forced&nbsp;
to work unlawfully on a fishing boat for weeks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.200
at a time with no health care or safety equipment&nbsp;
there are even young girls being driven around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.800
country manipulated into having sex with strangers&nbsp;
these are just a few cases we've discovered and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.120
there are many many more stories like them the&nbsp;
reality is that this is an organised and pervasive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.720
crime active across our nation and its victims&nbsp;
and perpetrators hide in plain sight within our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:12.120
society in order to combat such a well connected&nbsp;
network we have to be even more connected we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.120
to be the eyes and ears in our communities looking&nbsp;
out for one another and have the tools to know it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.120
to see it and respond to it today we're going&nbsp;
to be exploring the ways that we as individuals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.800
can combat this crime and equip ourselves&nbsp;
to be able to end slavery and change lives
