00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:08.160
my name is Letisha and I am 18&nbsp;
years old I attend college but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.600
I don't really enjoy it or have any friends
I have always lived in Manchester but never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.480
felt comfortable due to my anxiety I tend to spend&nbsp;
a lot of time on my own as my mum's always out at

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.720
work one day at College I was approached by two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.960
girls who said they wanted&nbsp;
to be my friend and hang out

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.200
they seemed nice at first and bought me the&nbsp;
occasional can of Pop which I thought was kind

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.480
I started meeting up with them after college&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.040
and they introduced me to a group of&nbsp;
older boys that they said were their

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.760
friends one of the boys showed an interest in me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.400
and he paid me compliments&nbsp;
which made me feel really

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:03.600
good the boy started buying me food and alcohol&nbsp;
whilst we were out I thought I finally had a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.640
boyfriend and was happy then it all changed&nbsp;
he asked me to take an envelope to a nearby&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.640
address I asked him what was in it and he told&nbsp;
me that I owed him for everything he bought me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.240
and I should just do it when I refused and&nbsp;
I said I was going home he grabbed me by my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.840
arm and he threatened me he then took me to&nbsp;
a nearby flat and he told me to wait there
