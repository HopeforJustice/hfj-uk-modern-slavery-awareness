00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.960
human trafficking is defined in the Palermo protocol it&nbsp;
is a human rights issue this means that nations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.280
and their governments have obligations under&nbsp;
international human rights law to take action&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.320
to prevent trafficking identify protect and&nbsp;
assist victims as well as hold perpetrators&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.600
to account understanding human trafficking&nbsp;
and other forms of modern slavery as a human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.200
rights issue is critical because it helps us&nbsp;
look beyond a solely criminal justice focused&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.440
approach and place individuals at risk or who are&nbsp;
experiencing exploitation right at the centre of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:50.000
the response with a clear focus on prevention and&nbsp;
protection there are a number of key provisions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.680
within international human rights law that are&nbsp;
applicable one of the most prominent for the UK&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.200
is a prohibition of slavery servitude and forced&nbsp;
or compulsory labour which we can find in article&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:08.240
four of the European convention on human rights&nbsp;
and in domestic law via the Human Rights Act the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.920
European Court of human rights in interpreting the&nbsp;
convention has confirmed in a number of key cases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.480
that human trafficking falls within the scope of&nbsp;
article four and that to comply with its obligations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:26.120
states must among other things take operational&nbsp;
measures to identify and protect those being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:33.800
exploited for me a human rights based approach&nbsp;
is really critical because it places the rights&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:44.120
of individuals at the centre of the response&nbsp;
ensuring the equality and dignity of all people
